## adc-pixapp
React app to manage pictures of the website [Acier Design Cr√©ation](https://acierdesigncreation.com/en). We can add/delete pictures, and update information (city / description) in 2 languages (en / fr). This information is stored in a JSON file server side.

Only the code, no config/generated files because the original project is a little mixed up with another one.

It could be optimized with more time (SSR, no full load on first render, virtualization, ...).
