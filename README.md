## adc-pixapp
React app to manage pictures of the website [Acier Design CrÃ©ation](https://acierdesigncreation.com/en). We can add/delete pictures, and update information (city / description) in 2 languages (en / fr). This information is stored in a JSON file server side.

It could be optimized with more time (SSR, no full load on first render, virtualization, ...).

[See it in action!](http://pixapp.eu-west-3.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

*It uses the mock server `server.js` so don't fear the alert: no real website will be harmed.* ðŸ˜„
